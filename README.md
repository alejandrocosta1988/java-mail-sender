# java-mail-sender

This project was created while studying the possibility of sending e-mail using the javax.mail.
By now, there are two classes implemented. One class (`UserMailData`) holds the data related to the sender mail (user name and password). The other (`EnvioDeEmail`) provides the method to actually send the e-mail, and many other necessary information for configuration and the text of the e-mail itself. 
This means that this class is currently overloaded with several responsabilities. It will be broken into other classes soon.
Come back in my GitHub later and check for possible updates in the code. It will be improved in time.
